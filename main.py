delivery_days: How many days did it take \
for the product to arrive? If this \
information is not found, output No information about this.

price_perception: How does it feel the customer about the price? 
Answer Expensive if the customer feels the product is expensive,

not, Neutral if either of them, or Unknown if unknown.

following keys:
- Sentiment
- How long took it to deliver?

This dress is pretty amazing. It arrived in two days, just in time for my wife's anniversary present. It is cheaper than the other dresses out there, but I think it is worth it for the extra features.

- Sentiment: Positive
- How long took it to deliver? 2 days
- How was the price perceived? Cheap
